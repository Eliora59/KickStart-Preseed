# KickStart

This repository contains kickstarts files for Debian (preseed) and RedHat (kickstart) for auto install of virtual machines  

I self-hosted my files on my website :
- ks.overcomputing.net/preseed
- ks.overcomputing.net/kickstart

This Kickstart is a minimal installation that deletes all partitions. It deploy root account with "root" password and allows SSH connexion.
These kickstarts are only for testing on VMs.
